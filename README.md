# Sprint-9th-grade-Math-Games
## Meet our team!
Our project is based on the guess-a-word game, widely popular among the world - **WORDLE!** The code was written by a 5-member team, consisting of:
- Elizaveta Furnika, as a _Scrum trainer_;
- Daria Larichkina, as a _BackEnd developer_;
- Georgy Dobrev, as a _FrontEnd developer_;
- Ivan Beknev, as a _Designer_;
- Varvara Safonova, as a _Second Designer_;
## What is our mission?
First of all, we aim to get better at coding. We realize the importance of being able to work with various functions, commands and nuances, and thus we put much effort into learning and getting better!
