# Sprint-9th-grade-Math-Games
## 👨🏻‍👩🏻‍👧🏻 Meet our team!
Our project is based on the guess-a-word game, widely popular around the world - **WORDLE!** The code was written by a 5-member team, consisting of:
- Elizaveta Furnika, as a _Scrum trainer_;
- Daria Larichkina, as a _BackEnd developer_;
- Georgy Dobrev, as a _FrontEnd developer_;
- Ivan Beknev, as a _Designer_;
- Varvara Safonova, as a _Second Designer_;
#### !📚 Meet our _Mentor_ - Antoniya Taneva, who gave us instructions and clarifications when needed 📚!
## ✨ What is our mission?
First of all, we aim to get better at coding. We realize the importance of being able to work with various functions, commands and their nuances, and thus we put much effort into learning and getting better! Secondly, we simply have fun, which isn't any less important.
And last but not least, we learn to work together, helping each other and trying our best to shine as bright as fireflies - in Russian, **светлячок** - do.

## 🦅 Why did we choose WORDLE?
♡ WORDLE is an overall popular game, but our class got acquainted with it mostly due to American teachers' influence. They showed us that learning new words by guessing a secret word is a great recreation and fun! During the lessons we often play WORDLE as a warm-up, and step by step, many of us got roped in. 
♡ WORDLE is generally known as a way to relax, train your brain and extend your vocabulary. We highly reccomend to both adults and children to try the original wordle game or play our self-made version of it!
